# everforest-userstyles-css

This is a growing collection of sites that I have everforest'd with some slick custom css. Some styles may not be 100% complete, and my look a bit odd.
If you find something not styled correctly or if you have some issues, feel free to open and issue/pull request, as contributions are welcome.

### Current List of Supported Sites:
- [github.com](https://github.com) (github gists are not styled atm)
	- 80% (ish) complete
- [notabug.org](https://notabug.org)
	- 96% complete (finished for the most part)

### Installation:
To use these themes in your browser, you need something that will inject css styling. For Chromium-based and Firefox-based web browsers, you can use the [stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
browser plugin to inject css.
You can simply paste content into a new stylus theme directly from files in this repository. You will need to set they style url option to "Urls Starting With" with the proper url following.
